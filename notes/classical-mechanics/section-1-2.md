# Contraints 

Two particles in 3D connected by a rigid rod. If no rigid rod was present there would be six degrees of freedom per particle, with the rod there is 5 because the distance between each other is fixed.

Define $\vec{r}_1,\vec{r}_2,\vec{r}_3,...\vec{r}_N$ not independent (therefore there are constaints)

Holonomic contraints
$$f(\vec{r}_1,\vec{r}_2,...\vec{r}_N, t)=0$$ is a holonomic contraint.  
Not all constraints are holonomic, for example a particle in a box. $0\leq x\leq L$. This is non-holonomic, we will be working with only holonomic constaints.  
$$f_1(\vec{r}_1,...\vec{r}_N, t)=0$$
$$f_2(\vec{r}_1,...\vec{r}_N, t)=0$$
$$f_3(\vec{r}_1,...\vec{r}_N, t)=0$$
$$f_1k(\vec{r}_1,...\vec{r}_N, t)=0$$
This is a set of k constraints, in the situation where we have N particles and k constaints, we can choose a set of **independent coordinates**.
# independent coordinates

$$n=3N-k$
These are typically denoted $q_1,q_2,...q_n$ which are all independent. Any cartesion coordinate:
$$\vec{r}_i=\vec{r}_i(q_1,...q_n,t)$$ 
is a function of those generalized coordinates.  
$$\vec{r}_i\to\vec{r}_i+d\vec{r}_i,\quad t\to t+dt$$
$$d\vec{r}_i=\frac{\partial \vec{r}_i}{\partial \vec{q}_j}dq_j+\frac{\partial \vec{r}_i}{\partial t}dt$$
If I keep time constant then the coorisponding infinitesimal change is called the *virtual displacement* $\partial \vec{r}_i$. So the two are:
$$d\vec{r}_i=\frac{\partial \vec{r}_i}{\partial \vec{q}_j}dq_j+\frac{\partial \vec{r}_i}{\partial t}dt$$
$$\partial r_i=\frac{\partial \vec{r}_i}{\partial \vec{q}_j}dq_j$$
Why do we need the notion of virtual displacement?  
**Example:** We have a bead that slides on wire, and gravitational force points down. What constrains this system? The normal force. Now the only forces I want to work with are applied forces, in this case just gravity. So the lagrangian formulism tries to get rid of the forces of constraint.  
The d'Alembert's principle says that the total work done by forces of constraint under a virtual displacement is zero. This is postulated not derived.  
Examples where this is true:  
1) A particle moving on a surface. Draw some general surface in 3D, there is a particle constained to move along it. The force of contraint is simply the normal force, keeping the particle on the surface. Since normal and displacement are perp, work is zero.
2) A particle constrained to move on a wire. Draw a general wire, and a beed moving along it, but the wire can move freely. The wire is specified by $\vec{r}_W=\vec{r}_W(l,t)$. Say this wire is moving down, what is the constaining force? Normal force. What is the virtual displacement? Simply the beeds movement along the wire (perpendicular to the normal so work is zero). The true displacement includes gravities acceleration and therefore is not perp to normal and there is work!
3) The double pendulum. Draw a typical double pendulum, with lengths $l_1$ and $l_2$ with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ respectively. The coordinates are $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$. There is two forces of contraint, $\vec{\tau}_1$ and $\vec{\tau}_2$. On the first mass there is a reaction force by the second mass $i\vec{\tau}_2$.  
The virtual displacement of the first mass is simply along the radius and therefore orthogonal to $\vec{\tau}_1$:
$$\vec{\tau}_1\cdot\partial\vec{r}_1=0$$
But:
$$\vec{\tau}_2\cdot\partial\vec{r}_1\neq 0$$
and
$$\vec{\tau}_2\cdot\partial\vec{r}_2\neq 0$$
Since they are not orthogonal! But the sum of the work:
$$\partial W=\vec{\tau}_1\cdot\partial\vec{r}_1+\vec{\tau}_2\cdot\partial\vec{r}_1-\vec{\tau}_2\cdot\partial\vec{r}_2=0$$
$$\partial W=-\vec{\tau}_2\cdot(\partial \vec{r}_2-\partial \vec{r}_1)=0$$
Not sure if I understand why this is zero, but I will work it out later.  

$$\dot{\vec{p}}_i=\vec{F}_i=\vec{F}_i^{(e)}+\vec{f}_i$$
Where big F super e is applied force and small f is the force of constaint.  
$$(\vec{F}_i-\dot{\vec{p}}_i)=0$$
$$(\vec{F}_i-\dot{\vec{p}}_i)\cdot \partial \vec{r}_i=0$$
$$\sum_{i}(\vec{F}_i-\dot{\vec{p}}_i-f_i)\cdot \partial \vec{r}_i=0$$
But $\sum_i f_i\cdot\partial\vec{r}_i=0$ so
$$\sum_{i}(\vec{F}_i-\dot{\vec{p}}_i)\cdot \partial \vec{r}_i=0$$
This is d'Alembert's principle.
